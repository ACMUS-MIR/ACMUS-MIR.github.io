Transfer learning has shown to be a powerful method in which models are first pre-trained for a task where abundant data is available, and then fine-tuned for a separate task where only a limited amount of data exists. In the past years, several models for audio classification have been pre-trained in a supervised or self-supervised fashion to learn complex feature representations, so called embeddings. These embeddings can then be extracted from smaller datasets and used to train subsequent classifiers. In the field of audio event detection (AED) for example, classifiers using these features have achieved high accuracy without the need of additional domain knowledge. This paper evaluates three state-of-the-art embeddings on six audio classification tasks from the fields of music information retrieval and industrial sound analysis, and presents a detailed overview of their potential. The embeddings are systematically evaluated by analyzing the influence of classifier architecture, fusion methods for file-wise predictions, amount of training data, and trained domain on classification accuracy. To better understand the effect of pre-training, results are also compared with those obtained with models trained from scratch. On average, OpenL3 embeddings performed best with a linear SVM classifier and for a reduced number of training examples they outperform the initial baseline.","tags":["Deep learning","Speech-music discrimination","Ensemble Size classification"],"title":"Analyzing the potential of pre-trained embeddings for audio classification tasks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fernando Mora-Ángel","Gustavo López Gil","Estefanía Cano","Sascha Grollmisch"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1564659243,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564659243,"objectID":"90d9de609f28f3e285e28e46259e5238","permalink":"https://acmus-mir.github.io/publication/acmus-mir19/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T19:34:03+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/acmus-mir19/","section":"publication","summary":"The music from the Andean region of Colombia has many particularities in terms of tempo, meter complexity and sesquialteras, tuning systems, scales, timbre, and texture. These particularities make its analysis with  state-of-the-art music information retrieval (MIR) methods both interesting and challenging. To support future research efforts in the context of Andean Colombian music, a new public data set was compiled and annotated by expert musicologists in Colombia. Our collection comprises three subsets: (1) The *rhythm set* with tempo and meter annotations, (2) the *instrumental format set* including number and types of instruments for each recording, and (3) the *scale set* reporting the musical scale of each audio segment. The data set was conceived with the goal of supporting the development of MIR techniques better suited for extraction of semantic information in Andean Colombian music. We hope that our data set will also encourage a wide range of studies in the fields of musicology, ethnomusicology, and music information retrieval.","tags":["Colombian Music"],"title":"ACMUS-MIR: An annotated data set of Andean Colombian music","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sascha Grollmisch","Estefanía Cano","Fernando Mora-Ángel","Gustavo López Gil"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1564659243,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564659243,"objectID":"250ce45e6819242f89e72b27964d85d6","permalink":"https://acmus-mir.github.io/publication/cmmr19/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T19:34:03+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cmmr19/","section":"publication","summary":"Reliable methods for automatic retrieval of semantic information from large digital music archives can play a critical role in musicological research and musical heritage preservation. With the advancement of machine learning techniques, new possibilities for information retrieval in scenarios where ground-truth data is scarce are now available. This work investigates the problem of counting the number of instruments in music recordings as a classification task. For this purpose, a new data set of Colombian Andean string music was compiled and annotated by  expert musicologists. Different neural network architectures, as well as pre-processing steps and data augmentation techniques were systematically evaluated and optimized. The best deep neural network architecture achieved 80.7% file-wise accuracy using only feed forward layers with linear magnitude spectrograms as input representation.

In particular, we are focusing on a collection of traditional Colombian music compiled in the Músicas Regionales archive at the Universidad de Antioquia in Medellín, Colombia. Of particular interest are a series of recordings of vocal expressions of indigenous cultures native to different regions of the country. These vocal expressions can either be very close to speech (almost asreciting something), can include some melodic elements, or can be closer to the concept of singing voice from a Western music perspective (exhibiting a defined melodic line). From anautomatic classification point of view, the traditional binary discrimination between speechand singing voice falls short, calling for a more general characterization of vocal expressions. For example, one may use a range[0,1] with 0 being pure speech,1 being singing voice (from a Western music perspective), and allowing everything that falls in between these bounds. In this context, interesting research questions arise: Is the degree of melodic elements in these vocal expressions informative for the region where a recording was made? Can we conclude the functional aspects of these recordings (ritual, prayer, social, playful, healing) based on this characterization? Could these categories be shared between different cultures?","tags":["Speech-music discrimination"],"title":"Singing Voice, Speech, or Something in Between","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We aim to develop methods to distinguish speech data from music data, and further provide fine-grained classification labels such as instrumental music or vocal music.

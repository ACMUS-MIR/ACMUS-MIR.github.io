With the advancement of machine learning techniques, new possibilities for information retrieval in scenarios where ground-truth data is scarce are now available. This work investigates the problem of counting the number of instruments in music recordings as a classification task. For this purpose, a new data set of Colombian Andean string music was compiled and annotated by  expert musicologists. Different neural network architectures, as well as pre-processing steps and data augmentation techniques were systematically evaluated and optimized. The best deep neural network architecture achieved 80.7% file-wise accuracy using only feed forward layers with linear magnitude spectrograms as input representation. This model will serve as a baseline for future research on ensemble size classification.","tags":[],"title":"Ensemble size classification in Colombian Andean string music recordings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Estefanía Cano","Fernando Mora-Ángel","Gustavo López Gil","José Ricardo Zapata","Antonio Escamilla"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1564658889,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564658889,"objectID":"a3f420870957382d5b2848846e43570b","permalink":"https://acmus-mir.github.io/publication/dagstuhl19/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T19:28:09+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/dagstuhl19/","section":"publication","summary":"In the context of the ACMus research project, we are investigating automatic techniquesfor annotation and segmentation of digital archives of non-western music. In particular,we are focusing on a collection of traditional Colombian music compiled in the MúsicasRegionales archive at the Universidad de Antioquia in Medellín, Colombia. Of particularinterest are a series of recordings of vocal expressions of indigenous cultures native to differentregions of the country. These vocal expressions can either be very close to speech (almost asreciting something), can include some melodic elements, or can be closer to the concept ofsinging voice from a Western music perspective (exhibiting a defined melodic line). From anautomatic classification point of view, the traditional binary discrimination between speechand singing voice falls short, calling for a more general characterization of vocal expressions.For example, one may use a range[0,1]with0being pure speech,1being singing voice (froma Western music perspective), and allowing everything that falls in between these bounds. Inthis context, interesting research questions arise: Is the degree of melodic elements in thesevocal expressions informative for the region where a recording was made? Can we concludethe functional aspects of these recordings (ritual, prayer, social, playful, healing) based onthis characterization? Could these categories be shared between different cultures?","tags":[],"title":"Singing Voice, Speech, or Something in Between","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561248000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561248000,"objectID":"821fb23fa7ae0d8a4cd5b3704c5de659","permalink":"https://acmus-mir.github.io/project/ensemblesize/","publishdate":"2019-06-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ensemblesize/","section":"project","summary":"Classification of ensemble size in music recordings","tags":["Computational Musicology"],"title":"Ensemble Size Classification","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561248000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561248000,"objectID":"034c81d2a49f4ef1e6139b9c5b206156","permalink":"https://acmus-mir.github.io/project/meterextraction/","publishdate":"2019-06-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/meterextraction/","section":"project","summary":"Classification of simple and compound meter","tags":["Computational Musicology"],"title":"Meter Extraction","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561248000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561248000,"objectID":"d56b1f150a8471960ecaed1263d38024","permalink":"https://acmus-mir.github.io/project/scale/","publishdate":"2019-06-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/scale/","section":"project","summary":"Detection of musical scales in audio recordings","tags":["Computational Musicology"],"title":"Music Scale Detection","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561248000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561248000,"objectID":"a87918dd911b21387974c61eae8cdedb","permalink":"https://acmus-mir.github.io/project/speechmusic/","publishdate":"2019-06-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/speechmusic/","section":"project","summary":"Discrimination between speech and music (intrumental and vocal).","tags":["Computational Musicology"],"title":"Speech music classification","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"60147d503a880f0c5d87fd2c408c0f66","permalink":"https://acmus-mir.github.io/acmus-mir/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/acmus-mir/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]

Christian found studies where all worlds came together and graduated with his engineering diploma in media technology in 2013. This award-winning diploma thesis has already been a co-operational research task at the university of technology Ilmenau and the Fraunhofer Institute of Media Technology. From there he worked in different industries like DCI, electro-mobility and medical healthcare before returning into the research sector again in 2019.
